# NoKey
These scripts are for AutoPlay Media Studio 8.x, this tool was created to stop windows keylogging your input, it can be used to create small notes and copy them to your clipboard or save it to a AES encoded file.

NoKey Source Scripts, Rather then just giving you the APZ I thought it would create scripts for you to include in your own work.
